## Alpha Playtesting Update (5/17/19 - 5/23/19)

It is the last few weeks of the school quarter, therefore we donâ€™t have the time we would like to spend to make Chromatic as polished as we would like. However, the mechanics have been tinkered enough with that we have a basis for the gameplay. Since it is a story game, having a well functioning mechanism for changing the color of objects based on the completion of specific events is a priority. So, although we want the game to look clean and pretty, we knew this past week that making it look pretty is not the main goal. 

With that, we completed the following items the past week:
- Color changing of objects through the game manager
- Fully functioning parallax art style 
- Outlining design goals for the prettiness of the game
- Structuring one of the puzzles to take input for a passcode

Things we still need to do:
Structure and design the scenes for the other puzzle levels (we have the prototypes completed from the 1st week!)
- Create design elements that follow our pixel art style
- Animate the main menu to fade into the game
- Animate the color change to not be as jarring
- Create the intro story scene
- Adjust dialogue to suite design changes

We could probably add to that list if we wanted to include our stretch goals. The process of creating Chromatic has been iterative. Ideas that were discussed during the paper prototype phase have been put aside as concepts that we acknowledge we will not have the time to implement, albeit they are really cool ideas. Ultimately we want a game that has the most achievable scope considering the amount of time we have for the assignment, while also being a game that conveys the story as passionately as we feel about Chromatic.
