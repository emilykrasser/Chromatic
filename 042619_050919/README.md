## Initial update (4/29/19 - 5/9/19)

We are Team Sonder and we are working on a game called Chromatic.
This week we were able to iron out the main theme of our game as well as the main mechanics. We made a paper prototype that covered the main mechanics and started on the digital prototype.

The roles for each team member has been split up as follows:
* Emily Krasser as the art person
* Kayla Sprague as the script technician
* Sufiah Ahmad as the ~~torturer~~ puzzlemaster
* All of us will be contributing to the main creation of the game

To Do list for this week:
- [x] Impliment item pickup and inventory
- [x] Impliment NPC interactions
- [x] Start implimenting puzzle 1
- [x] Impliment puzzle win condition
