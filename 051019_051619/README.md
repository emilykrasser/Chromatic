## Digital Prototype Update (5/10/19 - 5/16/19)

**Chromatic (krō-ˈma-tik) is defined by “of or relating to color or color phenomena or sensations”, which describes the development process thus far. An array of ideas have been shared and mutual enthusiasm has pushed us to develop the fundamental mechanics of the game. The following were our key prototype elements:**

_Main Menu_ 

We want players to have an introduction to the game that fairly represents the atmosphere. A monochromatic background was selected, which aligns with the story. Buttons are partially working, but ultimately it is a basis for the main menu that we would like to embellish on before the game is deployed. 

_Player Inventory_

As with all games that have an inventory system, the inventory is in charge of storing game items. In particular, this is a smart inventory that allows the player to use specific game items for specific interactions. Items will be used for NPC interactions, game object interactions, and puzzles. The inventory will be a permanent visual on the player’s screen.

_Object Pick-up_

Picking up objects goes hand-in-hand with having a player inventory. To pick up an object, a player presses ‘e’ and the object will be added to the player’s inventory. Objects are important for doing stuff in the game. 

_NPC Dialogue Interactions_

“Press e” to have dialogue interactions with NPC’s. Specifically we wanted dialogue to be different based on whether or not an event had occurred. Pre-event dialogue often provides players with direction on what to do next. During an event, dialogue will be reduced to having a simple “hi” type of response. Post-event the dialogue interaction will change based on the events completion. 

_Color Changing Game Objects_

Chromatic is dominantly a story game that relies on game objects adjusting in a unique way by changing color based on the occurrence of certain events. Without appropriate changes in color, the story doesn’t hold. We didn’t want just one color to appear though. We want shades of colors to appear. Through the game manager and booleans, we are solidifying an approach. 

_Parallax Art Style_

Although Chromatic is a 2D game, we wanted to add a 3D sort of depth to it to enhance the environments with this unique art style. 

Having a foundation for our game has brought new ideas to light, cool ways to build on concepts, and solidified what we plan on doing next:

- [ ] Game object interactions with inventory items to trigger events
- [ ] Implementing puzzle concepts and adding complexity for player challenge
- [ ] Maze puzzle
- [ ] Mouse puzzle (as in controlled by a player’s physical mouse input device)
- [ ] Fundamental Story Scenes
- [ ] NPC Sprites
