##Alpha Playtests
General Notes:
* Show a prompt to “press e” on top of interactable objects.

* If you click on the time capsule puzzle, then you cannot exit out of it.
* Not easy to know what to do.
* The escape button should do something.

##Final Playtests
1. Name: Leon Alschitz
Time Taken: Around 10 minutes
Favourite Puzzle: 1st puzzle (Passcode)
Favourite Character: None
			Favourite part of the game was the art.
Suggestions/Notes while playing the game: 
* Person still slides. Reduce the speed of walking, or increase the speed of animation.
* Should just have one interact button. 
* Invisible walls are very bad… 
* It would be cool if the lights started out as white, and the light got yellow meanwhile the post would get brown. 
* Don’t have the camera disappear even before the character reaches the bottom.
* If you have 2 portals left and right, then show the portals have different colors.
* “The lamp posts are the same from the beginning :(“.
* ESC should show a menu
* Have the portals play a different sound effect if you want to go through the end.
* The walking anim. slides and doesn’t match the distance travelled. 
* Have a sound clip for walking.
* Make the last puzzle more harder and complicated. More portals is not the answer. Maybe a certain order?
* From player’s own thoughts: Only puzzle to get stuck on was “Don’t make me count to…”
* The art was cool, but certain color did not appropriately change. The puzzle is not themed around the color. Hve the records be filled with “Blues music”.
* Add sound effects when characters talk.

3. 	Name: Junid Ahmad
Time Taken: 15 minutes 39 seconds
Favourite Puzzle: 1st puzzle (Passcode) (It actually made you think)
Favourite Character: Zalgo
Were the instructions clear? Weren’t exactly clear, but the puzzles were trial and error to solve.
Do you have any suggestions: 2nd puzzle is useless because you just have to pick up items. Have the 2nd puzzle be some kind of spatial puzzle, or something that requires some kind of skill. With a game, you want it to require a certain skills and to train that skill. For example in a tactical game then you are avoiding items, you need speed to avoid items. The storyline in this game also needs to be more clear. “Why is there no color?” The appreciation/deep stuff is good, but make it more obvious. Also not enough story and character development.

You guys did really good for the game and resources you had though.

Notes while playing the game:
* “Who is this Shaytan(Satan)?!” - LOL
* “Why is this game so emo??”
* In reference to DragonLady, “At this age she probably has osteoporosis.”
* In reference to DragonLady, “Is she referring to herself as a ‘bag of bones’?”.
* “The capsule looks like a football.”
* In reference to Zalgo, “Oooooh”.
* In reference to Zalgo, “I’m concerned about this person.”
* After the first puzzle, “This better be the last puzzle (lol)”.
* In reference to Zalgo, ”I’m still concerned about this person.”
* Sally: No keep going! 
Junid: I can’t. (character hits invisible wall) 
Sally: Oh. I’m sorry I doubted you.
* In reference to Oyvind’s character sprite, “Oh look a baby”.
* Random fact: “Gelb” is how some Saudis refer to “heart”.
* “To the sewers where I belong.”
* “Oooh, I’m gonna forget how to get back out.”
* “(In sewers), this whole game is peeking into my soul.”
* “No wonder his Gelb can’t get out of the sewers.” 
* Younger brother passing by after player has given his suggestions for improving the game: “Bro I didn’t know you could think this deep” (lol)
