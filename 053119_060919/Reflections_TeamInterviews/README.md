## Reflections: Team Interviews

### Emily Krasser
Our team made fantastic progress with this game. We didn’t have a whole lot of time to create this, considering that the project was only started halfway through the quarter, but we made do with the amount of time we had and created a great game. This is evidenced by the complete feeling that our game gives; when played, you can tell that it’s a full game in and of itself. All of the character interactions are there, all of the puzzle mechanics are present, and the fantasy worldbuilding is mostly complete. Quite a bit of the artwork was our own, with only the puzzle scene backgrounds being outsourced art assets. 

If we had another two weeks, I would say that the focus would be on making more challenging puzzles and more of them for each color, more places for the player to explore and more characters, making the game from all original artwork, and working on certain mechanics like npc image changes and world color changes.

Thankfully we’ll have that time since we’ll be continuing development over the summer!

Reflect on your process as well as answering the following questions: What is the one thing your team did really well? What evidence can you show for it? If you had another 2-weeks to work on the game, what would be the 3 highest priority items.

### Sufiah Ahmad
I think that the one thing we did well as a group was communicating, and our willingness to help the team. All of my members are hard working, and despite juggling other classes I felt like they all put in an admirable amount of effort. This can be seen in our entire game through the beautiful art created by Emily Krasser, and also the backgrounds that were found and added in by Kayla Sprague. 

If we had another 2 weeks to work on the game, then I think that the three things we would work on would be improving the second puzzle to make it more challenging, implementing more NPCs that the user can interact with, and adding a “fade” transition so that the color does not change so suddenly.
